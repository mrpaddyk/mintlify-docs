**Retail media enables brands to influence shoppers directly at the point of purchase. Through sponsored product campaigns, you as a supplier can gain greater visibility, drive more conversions, and benefit from transparent, performance-based advertising. This guide outlines how to manage campaigns within the self-service interface provided by [Retailer Name]. From setup to reporting, you can take full control of their campaign strategy and performance.** 

## Campaign overview

When you log in, you’ll land on the **Campaign overview**. This view shows all your campaigns, along with key information and quick actions: 

- **Activate or pause campaigns** using the toggle next to each campaign. 
- **Edit campaigns** by clicking the pencil icon. 
- **Delete paused campaigns** via the trashcan icon or kebab menu. 
- **Access detailed performance reporting** by clicking the chart icon. 
- **View campaign details** using the “i” icon. 
- 

## Create a new campaign 

Click **“+ New campaign”** in the top-left corner to begin creating a new campaign. 

## Set targeting 

You can choose to target either **a category** or **specific products**: 

- **Category targeting** \
  Select a single product category using checkboxes. All products from your brand within the selected category will be eligible for promotion. [Retailer Name] automatically selects the most relevant products to feature based on bid strength, historical performance, and campaign settings. 

To promote across multiple categories, create one campaign per category. 

- **Manual product targeting** \
  Toggle **“Manual selection”** to handpick specific products from your feed. You can choose products across categories. Use **“Show selected only”** to focus your view on the selected items. 

**Set campaign details** 

After selecting your targeting method, click **“Next”** to configure: 

- Campaign name 
- Start and end dates 
- Target cost åer click (CPC) 
- Total budget 
- PO number (optional) 

 **Target Cost Per Click (CPC)** 

Target CPC is the average amount you're willing to pay per click. While daily CPC may vary, the system will optimize to reach your set average over time. 

If your campaign isn't receiving impressions or clicks, consider increasing your CPC to stay competitive. 

[Retailer Name] applies a **minimum bid threshold**. Campaigns below this minimum will not be eligible to serve. 

**Note:** Once the campaign is live, the CPC cannot be changed. 

 **Total Budget** 

This is the maximum amount your campaign can spend during its active period. The platform uses **budget pacing** to distribute spend evenly and ensure sustained visibility. Campaigns with low budgets or long durations may show less frequently each day. 

 **Activate or pause a campaign** 

New campaigns are created in a **paused state**. Use the toggle to activate or pause the campaign as needed. The campaign will only begin delivering from its scheduled start date.

**Dashboard view** \
Located in the left-hand menu, the dashboard offers a snapshot of all campaigns:

Data refreshes every 30–60 minutes.

Click the **chart icon** next to a campaign to view detailed performance metrics. You can:
